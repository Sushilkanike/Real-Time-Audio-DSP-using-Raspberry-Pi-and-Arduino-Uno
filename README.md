# Real-Time-Audio-DSP-using-Raspberry-Pi-and-Arduino-Uno
This Repository Contains Pure Data patch for DSP effects 
like 3BandEQ, Delay, Reverb and Arduino code to read pots data to control the Audio parameters in Real-Time.

To read the serial data from Arduino pd-comport library need to be installed.
The patch is designed for 6 potentiometers and there are 7 paremeters where one value is function of another.

Algorithms implemented and Stacked as 3-Band Equaliser | Delay Line Modulation with variable feedback | Reverberation
